In these tutorials, I will cover the necessary steps and derivations for some baseline DSGE models and their usage in Dynare: (i) RBC model, (ii) baseline New-Keynesian model, and (iii) Smets-Wouters (2007) model:

- [RBC model](rbc)

- [Baseline New Keynesian model](newkeynesian)

- [An and Schorfheide (2007) model](anscho2007)

- [Smets and Wouters (2007) model](sw2007)
