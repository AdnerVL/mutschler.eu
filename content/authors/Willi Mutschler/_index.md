I am an *Assistant Professor* in *International Macroeconomics* at the [University of Tuebingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/19615). My research interests include quantitative macroeconomics and econometrics with a focus on developing identification and estimation methods for dynamic and stochastic models with skewed distributions and rare disasters.

I am a member of [Dynare's](https://www.dynare.org/about/#team) core development team and maintain the identification and method-of-moments toolboxes.
You are highly encouraged to check out my [Dynare Teaching Materials](dynare)
  and courses on [Computational Macroeconomics](https://github.com/wmutschl/Computational-Macroeconomics) and [Quantitative Macroeconomics](https://github.com/wmutschl/Quantitative-Macroeconomics).

Feel free to *[contact](#contact)* me directly or to *[schedule an appointment](https://schedule.mutschler.eu)*.
