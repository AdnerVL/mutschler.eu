I am a researcher in Econometrics, Macroeconomics and Statistics and currently lead a research group, funded by the DFG, at the University Münster. My research interests include quantitative macroeconomics, econometrics and time series analysis with a focus on the methodological development of Frequentist and Bayesian identification and estimation methods for dynamic and stochastic models with time-varying risks and rare disasters. I have taught classes at all levels in DSGE Models, Econometrics, Empirical Methods, Macroeconomics, Statistics as well as Software courses in R, MATLAB, and Dynare.

I am a *Linux* and *open-source enthusiast* and actively contribute to several *projects* (such as [Dynare](https://dynare.org) and [Timeshift](https://github.com/wmutschl/timeshift-autosnap-apt)). You can find me on various forums ([Dynare](https://forum.dynare.org/u/wmutschl), [Destination Linux](https://discourse.destinationlinux.network/u/wmutschl/), [EndeavourOS](https://forum.endeavouros.com/u/wmutschl), [Manjaro](https://forum.manjaro.org/u/wmutschl), [Pop!_Planet](https://pop-planet.info/forums/members/wmutschl.104), [Ubuntu](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/u/wmutschl)) or feel free to [contact](#contact) me directly.
