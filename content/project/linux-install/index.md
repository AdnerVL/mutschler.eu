My favorite Linux distributions are Pop!_OS, Ubuntu and Manjaro. In this project, I am covering my installation processes, experiences, and personal setup for the different distributions. Also you will find here my contributions to [timeshift-autosnap](https://gitlab.com/gobonja/timeshift-autosnap) and [timeshift-autosnap-apt](https://gitlab.com/gobonja/timeshift-autosnap) of which I am a developer.

I try to do both, provide written guides as well as videos about e.g. my installation process or stuff I do with Linux. For instance, I really like to use btrfs as a file system (until Ubuntu's ZFS support and implementation takes over), so the official installation processes need to be adapted and I will show how. Also I cover how to set up a RAID 1 on my systems.

You can find the guides and links to YouTube videos on a dedicated sub page: [Installation Guides](../../linux/install-guides) and on my new [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiN_C6lGtCc-KbqCP1XuWgMp4ky634v0X).
