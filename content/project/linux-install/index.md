My favorite Linux distributions are Pop!_OS, Ubuntu and Fedora. In this project, I am covering my installation processes, experiences, and personal setup for the different distributions. Also you will find here my contributions to [Timeshift-autosnap](https://gitlab.com/gobonja/timeshift-autosnap) and [Timeshift-autosnap-apt](https://github.com/wmutschl/timeshift-autosnap-apt) of which I am a developer.

I try to do both, provide written guides as well as post videos about my installation process or stuff I do with Linux. For instance, I really like to use BTRFS as a file system, so the official installation processes need to be adapted and I will show how to do so.

You can find the guides and YouTube videos on a dedicated sub page: [Installation Guides](../../linux/install-guides) and on my new [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiN_C6lGtCc-KbqCP1XuWgMp4ky634v0X).
