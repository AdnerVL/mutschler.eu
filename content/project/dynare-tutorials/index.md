We have evaluated the results of Dynare's first user survey. One thing that came up frequently was a wish for more tutorials and examples on all the features Dynare offers. Albeit the manual covers most of it, it is a reference but not a user guide. Note that there is an outdated user guide which we do not support anymore, and which has also several errors in it.

So we decided that a milestone of Dynare 4.7 should be better documentation and a new User Guide. I am quite thankful that [Johannes Pfeifer](https://sites.google.com/site/pfeiferecon/dynare) took the lead concerning the User Guide. I will, however, also post and update my teaching materials as written tutorials and create several instructional videos on YouTube.

You can find everything on a dedicated subpage: [Dynare](https://mutschler.eu/dynare/) and on my new [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkW18RGgmhKg7Z-H9kYD2dg).

If you want a tutorial on a specific topic, please let me know!
